### CI Job Failure

The CI job has encountered the following issues:

1. **Missing `package-lock.json`:** The job failed because `npm ci` requires the `package-lock.json` file, which is currently missing.

2. **Docker Build Failure:** The Docker build failed due to the absence of the `/app/public` directory.

### Suggested Fixes:
- Commit a `package-lock.json` generated by `npm install`.
- Ensure that the `/app/public` directory exists after the build or update the Dockerfile to skip copying it if it's not needed.
